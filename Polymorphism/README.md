### Polymorphism Pattern

The **Polymorphism** pattern is a fundamental principle in object-oriented design that allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class. It enables a single interface to represent different types of objects, allowing for flexibility and the ability to extend systems with minimal changes.

#### Key Features:
- **Dynamic Method Binding**: Allows the method to execute based on the actual object's type at runtime, not the reference type.
- **Common Interface**: Implements a uniform interface to perform operations on different objects, enhancing code flexibility.
- **Extensibility**: Allows new classes to be introduced without changing the existing code that uses the polymorphic types.

#### Benefits:
- **Flexibility and Extensibility**: Systems can be easily extended to accommodate new behaviors without altering existing code.
- **Code Reusability**: Encourages code reuse by using a common interface for different implementations.
- **Simplified Maintenance**: Simplifies maintenance by decoupling what needs to be done from how it is done.

#### Potential Problems:
- **Complexity in Hierarchies**: Extensive use can lead to complex class hierarchies and make understanding the system more challenging.
- **Performance Overhead**: Dynamic binding has a slight runtime cost compared to static binding.
- **Interface Overhead**: Designing a robust and future-proof interface can be challenging in highly dynamic contexts.

### Summary:
The Polymorphism pattern leverages the concept of dynamic method invocation to enable a single interface to interact with different types of objects, providing flexibility and extensibility in software design. This facilitates a cleaner, more modular approach to handling a variety of implementations and behaviors, fostering a more adaptable codebase.
