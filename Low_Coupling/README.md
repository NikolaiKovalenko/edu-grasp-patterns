### Low Coupling Pattern

The **Low Coupling** pattern is a principle focused on reducing the dependencies between classes and components in software design. It aims to make the system more modular, flexible, and easier to maintain by minimizing the interdependencies among components. This principle is critical for creating systems that are resilient to change and easier to test and refactor.

#### Key Features:
- **Minimized Dependencies**: Aims to reduce the number of dependencies between components, classes, or modules.
- **Impact Isolation**: Ensures that changes to one component have minimal impact on others.
- **Modular Design**: Promotes the separation of concerns, making components more modular and cohesive.

#### Benefits:
- **Ease of Maintenance**: Systems with low coupling are easier to maintain because changes in one part of the system are less likely to require changes in another.
- **Improved Testability**: Loosely coupled components can be tested independently from one another.
- **Enhanced Flexibility**: It is easier to replace or modify parts of the system without affecting others.

#### Potential Problems:
- **Complexity in Design**: Achieving low coupling might require additional design considerations, like introducing interfaces or abstractions, which can add complexity.
- **Performance Overhead**: In some cases, reducing coupling might lead to additional layers of indirection, potentially impacting performance.

### Summary:
The Low Coupling pattern emphasizes designing systems with minimal dependencies between components. The example illustrates how using interfaces to decouple the components leads to a flexible and maintainable design, enabling easy swapping of implementations or adding new ones without impacting the existing system structure.
