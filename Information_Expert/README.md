### Information Expert Pattern

The **Information Expert** pattern is one of the key GRASP (General Responsibility Assignment Software Principles) principles. It suggests that responsibilities should be assigned to the classes that have the necessary information to fulfill them. This promotes a design where classes are cohesive and encapsulate relevant data and behavior together.

#### Key Features:
- **Responsibility Assignment**: Assigns responsibilities to components or classes that possess the information needed to execute that responsibility.
- **Cohesion**: Increases the cohesion of classes since functionality is kept within classes that hold the relevant data.
- **Encapsulation**: Supports encapsulation by ensuring that each class handles its own data and related methods.

#### Benefits:
- **Reduced Coupling**: By keeping related data and behavior together, it reduces the coupling between classes. Changes in one class are less likely to impact others.
- **Simplified Maintenance**: Systems are easier to maintain when responsibilities are distributed logically based on information curation.
- **Improved Clarity**: Clarifies the role of each class, making it easier to understand and enhance the system.

#### Potential Problems:
- **Misassignment of Responsibility**: If not applied carefully, there is a risk of assigning too many responsibilities to a single class, leading to a violation of the Single Responsibility Principle.
- **Increased Complexity**: In complex systems, determining the "expert" might not be straightforward and can complicate designs.
- **Dependency on Concrete Classes**: Relying heavily on information encapsulation might lead to tight coupling with concrete classes if not managed.

### Summary:
The Information Expert pattern promotes allocating responsibilities to the right classes based on their data, leading to a modular, maintainable, and cohesive design. By encapsulating behavior and data together, the pattern encourages logical grouping and reduces dependencies across the system.
