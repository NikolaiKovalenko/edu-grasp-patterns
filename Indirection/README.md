### Indirection Pattern

The **Indirection** pattern is a GRASP (General Responsibility Assignment Software Principles) pattern that suggests introducing an intermediate class or component to mediate between two modules, thus decoupling them. This pattern addresses the problem of tight coupling by providing a mechanism to introduce a layer of indirection.

#### Key Features:
- **Decoupling**: Reduces direct dependencies between modules or components, promoting loose coupling.
- **Intermediary Layer**: Introduces an intermediary that handles communication or coordination between components.
- **Flexibility**: Allows changes to one component without affecting others, as communication is handled indirectly.

#### Benefits:
- **Improved Modularity**: By decoupling components, each becomes more modular and easier to change or replace.
- **Enhanced Maintainability**: Lower coupling results in a system that is easier to maintain and understand.
- **Scalability**: Facilitates scaling by isolating changes and dependencies.

#### Potential Problems:
- **Increased Complexity**: Adding layers of indirection can introduce complexity and might make the system harder to understand at first glance.
- **Performance Overhead**: Additional processing steps can lead to performance overhead, particularly in performance-critical applications.

### Summary:
The Indirection pattern introduces a mediator between components to facilitate loose coupling, improving modularity and flexibility while ensuring that dependency management is clean. It highlights how adding an extra layer can help isolate changes and manage dependencies more effectively, providing a scalable architecture.
