### High Cohesion Pattern

The **High Cohesion** pattern is a design principle aimed at creating classes and components that are focused, clear, and have a single, well-defined purpose. High cohesion refers to how closely related and focused the responsibilities of a single module or class are. This principle leads to systems that are easier to understand, maintain, and evolve.

#### Key Features:
- **Focused Responsibilities**: Classes and methods have clearly defined responsibilities and focus on a specific task.
- **Single Responsibility**: Each component should have one reason to change, honoring the Single Responsibility Principle.
- **Logical Grouping**: Related behaviors and data are grouped together in the same module or class.

#### Benefits:
- **Ease of Maintenance**: Highly cohesive classes are easier to maintain because they are focused on a specific set of tasks.
- **Improved Reusability**: Cohesive units are often more reusable because they encapsulate a single, well-defined functionality.
- **Enhanced Understandability**: With each class or method having a clear purpose, the system is easier to understand.

#### Potential Problems:
- **Over-Partitioning**: Extreme focus on cohesion might lead to too many small classes or methods, making the system unnecessarily complex.
- **Refactoring Needs**: Achieving high cohesion may require significant refactoring in systems where responsibilities are not clearly defined.

### Summary:
The High Cohesion pattern ensures that each class or module is highly focused on performing a specific set of related functions. This design principle results in systems that are easier to maintain and adapt. By grouping related functionalities and responsibilities, cohesive systems lead to better organized, understandable, and reusable code.
