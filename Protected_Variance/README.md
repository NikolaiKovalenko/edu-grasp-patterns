### Protected Variations Pattern

The **Protected Variations** pattern is a GRASP (General Responsibility Assignment Software Principles) pattern that focuses on identifying points of potential change or variation in a system and shielding other parts of the system from those changes. It aims to design software so that variations or instabilities do not affect other parts of the system.

#### Key Features:
- **Anticipation of Change**: Recognizes and encapsulates areas in the system that are likely to change.
- **Interfaces and Abstractions**: Utilizes interfaces, abstract classes, or design patterns like Strategy, Adapter, or Facade to isolate changes.
- **Stability**: Creates a stable interface to protect clients from variations in the underlying implementation.

#### Benefits:
- **Reduced Risk**: Minimizes the impact of changes in a system, reducing the risk of breaking existing functionality when changes occur.
- **Enhanced Flexibility**: Increases the system's ability to adapt to new requirements by encapsulating change.
- **Improved Maintenance**: Simplifies maintenance by localizing changes to specific parts of the system.

#### Potential Problems:
- **Complexity**: Over-anticipating changes can lead to unnecessary complexity by adding additional layers of abstraction.
- **Performance Overhead**: Abstraction layers might introduce performance costs, especially in time-sensitive applications.

### Summary:
The Protected Variations pattern increases system resilience to change by encapsulating potential variation points within stable interfaces or abstractions, allowing systems to adapt without widespread modification. By predicting areas of change and protecting them, this pattern aids in building maintainable, adaptable systems that can evolve with minimal disruption.
